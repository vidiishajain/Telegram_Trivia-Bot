# Agent Starter (Python)

An opinionated, batteries-included starter for building AI agents — from simple scripts to Telegram bots to small web apps. You clone it, point Claude Code at it, and build.

> **One clone = one project.** Starting a new agent? Clone a fresh copy.

## ✏️ Your project

> Replace this section with *your* goal (this is stage 2 of the method — see below).
> Keep it to a few sentences a friend would understand.

**What I'm building:** _(one sentence)_

**Who it's for and why:** _(a sentence or two)_

**What "done" looks like:** _(what can the user do that they couldn't before?)_

## Quickstart

You need [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed (it manages Python and dependencies). Then:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (uv reads the lockfile and sets up Python 3.12)
uv sync

# 2. Create your .env and add your keys
cp .env.example .env
#    open .env and fill in OPENROUTER_API_KEY (the others are optional)

# 3. Check everything is wired up
uv run agent-doctor

# 4. Run the example agent
uv run agent
```

`agent-doctor` prints your environment, which credentials are set, and whether the live services respond (it even enables `pgvector` if you've set a database). Green ticks mean you're ready.

## What's in the box

- **LLMs** via OpenRouter — pick a model by *tier* (`fast`, `balanced`, `smart`, `research`), plus embeddings and web research with sources.
- **Media** via fal.ai — generate images/audio/etc. with one call, optionally saved to your storage.
- **Storage** via Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible) — upload files, get durable links.
- **Database** via Neon Postgres — async, with a tiny built-in migration runner and `pgvector` for embeddings.
- **Logging** to console + `logs/agent.log`, a **doctor** to check your setup, and a clean **CLI** and **web** (FastAPI + HTMX + Tailwind) starting point.

Two runnable demos live in [`examples/`](examples/) — read them, run them, then delete them:
- `examples/build_an_agent.py` — a terminal app that suggests an agent for you to build.
- `examples/agent_idea_web/` — a small web app: research → write-up → diagram → saved & shareable.

## How you build (the method)

This starter is built around a specific way of working — think first, document as you go, build and test small pieces, then compose. The full method is in **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** (which also tells Claude how to help you), and each stage has a doc template in **[`docs/`](docs/)**. The single most important habit: keep **[`journal.md`](journal.md)** as you go.

## Common commands

```bash
uv run agent                  # run the example agent
uv run agent-doctor           # check your setup
uv run pytest                 # fast tests
uv run pytest -m integration  # live tests (need credentials)
uv run fastapi dev src/agent/web.py   # run the web app
```

## Configuration

All config is environment variables, loaded from `.env` (never commit it). See `.env.example` for every option. Only `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is required; add the rest when a project needs media, storage, or a database.
